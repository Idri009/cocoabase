# 🌱 Cocoa Chain – Onchain Plantation Management Protocol

**Cocoa Chain** is a decentralized, wallet-connected dApp for minting, tracking, and managing onchain cocoa plantations as verifiable digital assets. Built on Next.js with **Reown AppKit** (WalletConnect) integration, every plantation is tokenized, every transaction is onchain, and every harvest is immutable.

## 🎉 40 Onchain Features Total - 20 New Features Added!

Cocoa Chain now includes **40 total onchain features** (20 original + 20 brand new) fully integrated with Reown wallet connectivity. All features require wallet connection and use Reown AppKit for secure, decentralized operations. The **20 new features** include advanced trading, marketplace, and sustainability features. See the [20 New Onchain Features](#-20-new-onchain-features-powered-by-reown-wallet) section below for complete details.

## 🔗 Onchain Architecture

Cocoa Chain leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, verifiable, and decentralized plantation management system. Each plantation is minted as an onchain asset, with all operations recorded immutably on the blockchain. **Powered by Reown AppKit**, the dApp provides seamless wallet connectivity across 300+ wallets.

### Core Web3 Stack
