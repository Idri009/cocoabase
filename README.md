# 🌱 Cocoa Chain – Onchain Plantation Management Protocol

**Cocoa Chain** is a decentralized, wallet-connected dApp for minting, tracking, and managing onchain cocoa plantations as verifiable digital assets. Built on Next.js with **Reown AppKit** (WalletConnect) integration, every plantation is tokenized, every transaction is onchain, and every harvest is immutable.

## 🔗 Onchain Architecture

Cocoa Chain leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, verifiable, and decentralized plantation management system. Each plantation is minted as an onchain asset, with all operations recorded immutably on the blockchain. **Powered by Reown AppKit**, the dApp provides seamless wallet connectivity across 300+ wallets.

### Core Web3 Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) – Modern React framework
- **Reown AppKit** (WalletConnect) – **Primary wallet connection layer** - Multi-wallet support via Reown
- **wagmi + viem** – Ethereum interaction hooks and utilities (integrated with Reown)
- **Zustand** – Decentralized state management
- **TanStack Query** – Web3 data caching and synchronization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
