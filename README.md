# 🌱 CocoaBase - Onchain Agricultural Management Platform

> **Revolutionizing Agriculture Through Blockchain Technology**

CocoaBase is a **pure onchain agricultural management protocol** built entirely on Ethereum-compatible blockchains, processing **280+ distinct onchain transaction types** through **363+ specialized smart contracts** that execute directly onchain without intermediaries.

Every agricultural operation—from seed planting to harvest, certification issuance to financial transactions—is recorded as immutable, verifiable onchain state on a decentralized ledger, creating permanent audit trails that are cryptographically secured and trustless.

Our smart contract architecture enables onchain crop management, livestock tracking, supply chain operations, financial services, and sustainability initiatives, transforming traditional farming into verifiable, tradeable digital assets that exist natively on the blockchain.

Through pure onchain execution, farmers can monetize sustainability efforts via carbon credit smart contracts, access decentralized finance protocols, participate in transparent supply chains, and build onchain reputations—all while consumers, investors, and regulators verify origin, quality, and compliance through immutable blockchain records.

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

### Real-World Challenges in Agriculture

1. **Lack of Transparency**: Supply chains are opaque, making it impossible to verify organic claims, fair trade practices, or sustainability claims
2. **Financial Exclusion**: Smallholder farmers lack access to credit, insurance, and fair market pricing
3. **Data Fragmentation**: Farm data is scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult to make informed decisions
4. **Counterfeit Products**: No reliable way to verify the origin and quality of agricultural products
5. **Inefficient Markets**: Middlemen take excessive cuts, leaving farmers with minimal profits
6. **Climate Risk**: Farmers lack access to affordable insurance and carbon credit markets
7. **Compliance Burden**: Manual record-keeping for certifications and compliance is time-consuming and error-prone

### Our Onchain Solution

CocoaBase leverages blockchain technology to create an **immutable, transparent, and decentralized** agricultural ecosystem where:

- ✅ **Every farm operation is recorded onchain** - From seed planting to harvest, creating an unalterable audit trail
- ✅ **NFTs represent real-world assets** - Plantations, equipment, and land are tokenized as verifiable digital assets
- ✅ **Smart contracts automate payments** - Eliminating intermediaries and ensuring fair, transparent transactions
- ✅ **Carbon credits are tradeable** - Farmers can monetize their sustainability efforts through onchain carbon markets
- ✅ **Supply chain is fully traceable** - Consumers can verify the origin and journey of every product
- ✅ **Financial services are accessible** - Microfinance, insurance pools, and crop financing are available to all farmers
- ✅ **Data is monetizable** - Farmers can sell their agricultural data while maintaining privacy

## 🏗️ Architecture

CocoaBase is built with:

- **Smart Contracts**: 363+ Solidity contracts covering every aspect of agricultural management
- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Wallet Integration**: Reown (WalletConnect) for seamless Web3 connectivity
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum-compatible networks (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Sepolia testnet)

### Compile Smart Contracts

```bash
# Compile all contracts
npm run compile
```

### Deploy to Local Network

1. **Start a local Hardhat node:**
   ```bash
   npm run node
   ```
   This starts a local blockchain on `http://127.0.0.1:8545`

2. **Deploy contracts:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:local
   ```

3. **Interact with contracts:**
   ```bash
   npm run interact:local
   ```

### Deploy to Sepolia Testnet

1. **Fund your deployment account** with Sepolia ETH (get from [faucets](https://sepoliafaucet.com/))

2. **Deploy contracts:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:sepolia
   ```

3. **Verify contracts on Etherscan:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>
   ```

### Deploy to Arbitrum

1. **Fund your deployment account** with ETH on Arbitrum

2. **Update hardhat.config.ts** with your Arbitrum RPC URL

3. **Deploy contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network arbitrum
   ```

### Deploy to Mainnet

⚠️ **WARNING**: Mainnet deployment costs real money. Test thoroughly on testnets first!

1. **Ensure all tests pass:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Review gas costs:**
   ```bash
   REPORT_GAS=true npm run compile
   ```

3. **Deploy with caution:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mainnet
   ```

### Deployment Scripts

The deployment process saves deployment information to `deployments/deployment-{timestamp}.json`:

```json
{
  "contractAddress": "0x...",
  "deployer": "0x...",
  "network": "sepolia",
  "chainId": "11155111",
  "deployedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Frontend Deployment

1. **Build the Next.js application:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start production server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Deploy to Vercel/Netlify:**
   - Connect your repository
   - Set environment variables
   - Deploy automatically on push

### Multi-Contract Deployment

To deploy all 243+ contracts, you can create a batch deployment script:

```javascript
// scripts/deploy-all.js
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");
const fs = require("fs");

async function main() {
  const contracts = [
    "PlantationNFT",
    "FarmComplianceReporting",
    "FarmCropMonitoring",
    // ... add all contracts
  ];
  
  const deployments = {};
  
  for (const contractName of contracts) {
    const Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory(contractName);
    const contract = await Contract.deploy();
    await contract.waitForDeployment();
    deployments[contractName] = await contract.getAddress();
    console.log(`${contractName} deployed to:`, deployments[contractName]);
  }
  
  fs.writeFileSync(
    "deployments/all-contracts.json",
    JSON.stringify(deployments, null, 2)
  );
}
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Never commit private keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** for sensitive data
- **Test thoroughly** on testnets before mainnet deployment
- **Audit contracts** before deploying with real funds
- **Use multi-sig wallets** for production deployments
- **Implement access controls** properly in contracts
- **Monitor gas costs** and optimize where possible
