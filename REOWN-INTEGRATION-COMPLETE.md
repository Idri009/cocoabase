# Reown Wallet Integration - Complete

## ✅ All Onchain Features Use Reown Wallet

Every single onchain feature in Cocoa Chain requires and uses **Reown AppKit** for wallet connectivity.

## Integration Details

### How It Works

1. **Wallet Connection**: All hooks use `useAccount()` from wagmi (powered by Reown)
   ```typescript
   const { address } = useAccount(); // Reown wallet address
   ```

2. **Contract Interactions**: All transactions use `useWriteContract()` from wagmi (powered by Reown)
   ```typescript
   const { writeContract } = useWriteContract(); // Reown contract interaction
   ```

3. **Error Handling**: All hooks check for wallet connection
   ```typescript
   if (!address) throw new Error('Wallet not connected via Reown');
   ```
